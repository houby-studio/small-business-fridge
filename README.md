# Small Bussiness Fridge

 Arduino + Express.js project offering small ordering system for fellow office colleagues.

## Getting Started

First of all, this is my first Express.js project and so it will take inspiration and know-how from YouTube channel **[Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w)** -> [Link to first part of the guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3vvxn78MH4).

You can either follow the guide as well and take inspiration from this project or simply fork this git repo and make few necessary changes to make it work for your environment.

## Forking repo

All you need to do is download this repo and setup your very own config file containing all sensitive information. That is something you should add to your `.gitignore` file so your sensitive information never leave your computer to public repository.

## Following tutorial

Well, you just watch the videos provided above and apply your own ideas in between.

*Small tip: Start with installing [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) with following command*:  
`npm install -g express-generator`  
`express --hbs`  
`npm install`
